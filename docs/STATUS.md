# auction-lang status

The build implements milestone M0 in the slices A1 to A6 and the post-A6
commit. It also has the core operations of the design (milestone M1 in
`SPEC.md`). M0 is done. M1 is in progress: `SPEC.md` section 9 records the
rulings on O5 to O8, and the slices B1 to B4 are done. M2 and M3 are not started.

## Implemented

- The type formers F1 to F15 on the tcc-json host (`formers/tcc-json.md`).
- The built-in types `Nat`, `Flag`, `Fin n`, `Rat` and `Matrix m n`, and
  their operations (`src/front/check.c:99-174`).
- `domain/finstoch.lang`: 10 definitions. The structure maps of FinStoch.
- `domain/auction.lang`: 81 definitions. Bid strategies, utilities,
  mechanisms, expected revenue, expected utility and the envelope objects.
- `domain/opengame.lang`: 90 definitions. The `OpenGame` family, bidders,
  the 2-bidder and 3-bidder auction games, their functions and the
  Bayes-Nash pipeline expectations.
- `domain/domain.lang`: 5 definitions and 4 families. The sample domain of
  lang-template.
- 22 example programs in `examples/`.
- The verbs `check`, `eval` and `build` of `build/langc`. `build` writes one
  JSON document (`docs/host/README.md`).
- The gate `make check` (`docs/VALIDATION.md`).

## Remaining M0 work

No M0 work remains. `SPEC.md` section 9 records the rulings on O1 to O4,
and each one is done. The M1 plan is in `SPEC.md` section 9 (the rulings
on O5 to O8) and section 10 (the slices B1 to B5). B1 to B4 are done. B5
remains.

## Known limits

- `Nat` is an unsigned 64-bit value. `natAdd` and `natMul` trap on
  overflow: `EVAL_OVERFLOW` (`test/emit/trap.lang`). `natSub` stops at 0.
- A division by 0 traps: `EVAL_DIV_ZERO` (`test/emit/divzero.lang`).
- `Rat` has a numerator above -2^63 and below 2^63 and a positive
  unsigned 64-bit denominator. Arithmetic that does not fit traps with
  `EVAL_OVERFLOW` (`docs/host/CAPABILITY.md`).
- Depth limits keep the C stack bounded. The parser stops at a nesting of
  1000 (`src/front/parser.c:16`). The checker stops at a depth of 2000
  (`src/front/check.c:10`). The evaluator stops at a depth of 2000
  (`src/front/core.h:17`). The JSON writer stops at a depth of 2000
  (`src/json.h:15`). No test in `test/` reaches the JSON depth limit.
- The evaluator has a fuel of 20,000,000 steps for each instance
  (`src/front/core.h:18`). No test in `test/` reaches the fuel limit.
- All memory comes from one arena of 1 GiB (`src/main.c:10`). A source file
  is at most 1 MiB (`src/front/front.h:7`).
- A matrix has at most 1 << 25 rows or columns and 1 << 25 cells
  (`src/front/eval.c:1100-1101`; `SPEC.md` O4, RULED 2026-10-08). A
  larger matrix refuses with `EVAL_MATRIX_SIZE`
  (`test/emit/mat-size.lang`). The limit also applies to intermediate
  matrices. Ordinary 3-bidder mechanisms work at n = 3 and n = 5;
  `test/emit/auction3-size.lang` checks their refusal at n = 13. The
  3-bidder open-game scores use the factored games of slice B4, so they
  work at n = 3; `test/emit/opengame-size.lang` checks their refusal at
  n = 4. The kron form of `auctionGame3` exceeds the limit at n = 3.
- The JSON `type` field of an instance is at most 4096 bytes.

## Internal boundaries

`src/front/` is the front end. `lexer.c` and `parser.c` read the source.
`check.c` holds the built-in table, the reserved names and the allow-list
refusals, and it checks the types. `eval.c` evaluates a term. `core.h` holds
the shared types and the evaluation limits.

`src/json.c` writes the JSON document of `build`. `src/main.c` holds the
command line verbs and the arena. The Makefile joins the 4 domain files into
`build/domain.c` with `gen/embed.c` (`Makefile:15`). Thus each domain name is
a core name.

`test/gate.sh` runs the tests. `test/parse/expect.txt` lists the parse
refusals. `test/check/expect.txt` lists the check refusals.
`test/emit/expect.txt` lists the build refusals. `test/eval/expect.txt`
lists the eval lines. `test/json/` holds the JSON golden of each example.

A program cannot declare a family (rule R1, `REFUSE_DATA`). It can use core
names, but cannot declare a definition with a core name (rule R4,
`REFUSE_NAME`). It cannot use a name of the allow-list refusals
(`REFUSE_ALLOW`). It cannot use text (`LEX_CHAR`).
